# Another approach about a legendary program
Most programmers know the **Hello World** program used to introduce to a novice about a computer programming language. From *Programming in C: A Tutorial* of Brian Kernighan, the instance of the **Hello World** program is like following: 
```C
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```
This program illustrates the basic of C-programming language syntax as simplest way as everyone can understand the function of this program: It outputs (or displays) *"hello, world"* (with line ending) to a user by calling **printf** utility in **stdio** library. This article have another approach about this legendary program: *How does it can display text in the console?*
