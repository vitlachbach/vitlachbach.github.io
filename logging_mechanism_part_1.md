# Another approach to a legendary program
## Prelude
Most programmers know the **Hello World** program (**HWp**) used to introduce to a novice about a computer programming language. From *Programming in C: A Tutorial* of Brian Kernighan, the instance of the **HWp** is like following: 
```C
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```
This program illustrates the basic of C-programming language syntax as simplest way as every *developer* can understand the function of this program: It outputs (or displays) *"hello, world"* (with line ending) to a user by calling **printf** utility in **stdio** library. This article have another approach about this legendary program: *How does it can display text in the console?*

## Some assumptions before we continue
Before start to find the answer of the topic's main question, We assume some concepts and configurations to limit our scope:
    * We have a basic background about Operating Systems, programming language compiler, linker, Device driver, system call.
    * We use **Linux** enviroment to trace the **HWp** step by step. In this article, I use a Linux VMware instance with following parameter:

```bash
        $ uname -a
        Linux ubuntu 4.15.0-30-generic #32~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 26 20:25:39 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
        $ gcc --version
        gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10) 5.4.0 20160609

## What is printf?
If we *google* with *"printf man"* phrase, maybe you can find that *printf* function is declare like this:
```C
int printf(const char *format, ...);
```
and this function will produce output to **stdout** according to a format. Please goto this url https://linux.die.net/man/3/printf for more detail description.
## How to use printf?
Let's see some actions: include stdio.h library, format the output, etc ... And I know, for sure, that it would be so boring if I described these action in detail :) .

## How printf work?
It will be *die-hard* method if we trace the complexity source code of Linux system to understand what exactly *printf* function do at this time. I choose a lazy-effective one: use application debug tool.
Firstly, we create the main_1.c file and edit the **HWp**.
```C
//main_1.c
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

```bash
$ gcc -Wall main_1.c -o printf_app

The results of *nm* or *strace* command look so horrible. But please do not be discouraged. It is really straightforward and I will explain.

Firstly, the following diagram describes a architecture of **Linux** application:

![Image of Linux application architecture](https://github.com/vitlachbach/vitlachbach.github.io/blob/master/images/logging_mechanism_part_1/app_layer.png)

Fig 01. Linux application architecture
It shows that each application will be create by its logic process and by linking (dynamic/static) of C runtime libraries. Each C runtime library will call the Operating System API by a system-call. Each line of **strace** command is a runtime system call from the *printf_app* application. Ignore some other system call of *printf_app* application to focus about our topic, We've just see following system call:
```bash
write(1, "Hello world\n", 12Hello world
```
This system call means that finally, the *printf_app* will call to device driver by *write* with file descriptor is 1 (stdout).

For more detail, if we use *gdb* to see more (using *stepi* command) about the printf call, we will find this calling sequence of the *printf_app*:
```bash
$ gdb ./printf_app
(gdb) start
(gdb) stepi
... many stepi go ...
0x00000000004009b7 in main ()
0x000000000040fa90 in puts ()
0x0000000000423820 in strlen ()
...
0x000000000041dbe0 in malloc ()
...
0x0000000000414fd0 in _IO_doallocbuf ()
...
0x0000000000462c80 in _IO_file_doallocate ()
...
0x00000000004133a0 in _IO_new_do_write ()
...
0x000000000043f3b0 in write ()
```

OOps, there is an apperance of memory allocation in the program sequence! What is happened actually ..? However it's seems that all for today.
 The sunken of the icebergs is still a alot of consider points:
    * Why does it need memory allocation?
    * The program need a buffer, doesn't it?
    * What is the mechanism of the memory buffer in printf?
    * How about the print in kernel mode?
## Pre-prologue
No doubt that **HWp** is one of the most famous one. Software engineers can easy understand the simple function of **HWp**. We also admit that **HWp**, such its basic syntax, be the beginning lesson of a C/C++ programmers. But if we want to be a professional one we should dig more the iceberg to see its sunken where there is a lot of consider points in advanced:
    * Why does it need memory allocation?
    * The program need a buffer, doesn't it?
    * What is the mechanism of the memory buffer in printf?
    * How about the print in kernel mode?
    * ...
